Know the Taxmann Difference!
During my long association with Taxmann spanning over 25 years, I have been regularly referring to Taxmann publication’s books and journals for my professional work. I find online resources available in Taxmann portal very comprehensive as it displays real-time updates on tax news, circulars, notifications and amendments to various fiscal regulations. Also, the Taxmann portal facilitates browsing of various Acts and Rules at the click of a mouse and provides easy access to vast database of analytical articles adding value to my professional works and research efforts with accuracy, efficiency, and quality.

My association with Taxmann is more than 20 years old now. The Taxmann website, apart from giving the latest news, circulars and notifications relevant for professionals, also serves as a “Knowledge Portal”, and is an excellent source of information. It includes analytical articles and updates on diverse subjects... They have the largest online database on taxation including direct tax, indirect tax and international taxation. The online research platform is very useful and enable us in tax planning activities. Taxmann App and Taxmann Twitter account is an indispensable tool for practicing professionals as well as those in the industry.
